browse-edit

browse-edit is a PHP text editor. It is password-protected on open and on save
to avoid unwanted saves. This means you have to input your password after you
have edited the file.

This editor saves the file as it is but puts its previous version into the backup/
directory. The filenames in the backu/ directory consist of the timestamp and
of the original name.

To browse directories, just input .. or directory names and press Ok / hit Enter.
The default password is SamplePassword.
